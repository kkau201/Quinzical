Changes made to akl_nz_jdt voice



Prior to 23rd March ( bit sketchy - but here is what I remember).
* In akl_nz_jdt_tokenizer.scm  
 (set! token_to_words akl_nz_jdt::token_to_words) to (set! token_to_words english_token_to_words)

So this is the a set of words that comes with the main realease - rad and kal - should check dictionary appropriate.

*in akl_nz.jdt_diphones.scm
Alex changed the intonation model to that of KAL (which is also used by rab).

ON March 23rd
* in akl_nz_jdt_durdata.scm
CIW changed duration values to those used by rab (and KAL). Added a value more values to the list, and checked the values - these actually look a bit strange to me, but will leave for now.

* tried to update duration tree with the gsw_dur one - didn't work - suspect I just don't know the syntax properly.

TO DO

Lexicon needs revisiting - Jono removing double entries but -may well remove wrong ones.

Need to look at use of ir phoneme - and how "here" and "hair" are realized. Also all "ing" endings realized as "in" - so would like to change. Plus a few other oddities.

Note that whilst punctuation marks work most of the time - need longer text for ? to work.
